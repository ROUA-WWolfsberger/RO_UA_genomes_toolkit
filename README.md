# "RO-UA Genomes" population analysis toolkint
## This repository is developed to facilitate easy-to-use population analysis of genomic data for new populations, specifically, for Ukrainian and Romanian populations genetated for "Partnership for Genomic Research in Ukraine and Romania" project EMS Code: 2SOFT/1.2/48"

Essentialy the toolkit guides future users to be able to reproduce for future projects. This toolkit is optimized for accessiblity, and is aimed to provide a comprehensive all-in-one solution for Eastern European populations for comparative analysis. Note that given some effort the toolkit can be converted to other regions. 
The toolkit essentially covers the following steps

### 1) Identification of novel, previously non reported alleles utilizing version 3 of The Genome Aggregation Database (GnomAD - https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)

### 2) Identification and filtering of common medically relevant alleles for the population

### 3) Organizing existing published populations for comparative analysis(Currently supports The International Genome Sample Resource, Human Genome Diversity Project, Simons Genome Diversity Project -https://www.internationalgenome.org/home)

### 4) Phasing the datasets to obtain data ready for all the future analyses 

### 5) Principal Component Analysis and vizualization of selected populations

### 6) STRUCTURE analysis and vizualization of investigated datasets

### 7) Comparative frequency analysis to identify Alleles unique to the population

Development was supported in part by 2SOFT/1.2/48 project "Partnership for Genomic Research in Ukraine and Romania" by the Joint Operational Programme Romania-Ukraine, through the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI).
